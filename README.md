# Leaf-disease-segmentation-

This thesis focuses on the segmentation of leaf diseases using three different models: UNet++, UNet, and YOLO. Initially, we compare the performance of these models to determine their effectiveness in accurately segmenting diseased areas on leaves. Each model's architecture and results are analyzed to provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses in this specific application.
